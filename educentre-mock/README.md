## Key Functional Flows

### Student Registration Flow

1. Parent applies through portal or admin creates registration
2. System validates IC and assigns income bracket

4. Student code generated automatically
5. Fee category assigned based on age group
6. Deposit amount calculated

### Invoice & Payment Flow

1. Monthly fee automatically billed at start of month
2. Subsidy offset applied based on category
3. Invoice triggered to IAS for AR posting
4. Parent receives notification (WhatsApp/Email/Portal)
5. Payment processed via FPX/JomPAY/Salary Deduction
6. Receipt generated and reconciled with IAS
7. Outstanding balance updated

### Attendance & Penalty Flow

1. Student check-in via Face ID/QR Code/Manual
2. Attendance recorded with timestamp
3. Absence triggers penalty calculation
4. Multiple absences generate alerts
5. Penalties added to next invoice

### Approval Workflow

Based on financial impact:
- ≤ RM 5,000: Centre Head
- RM 5,001 - RM 20,000: Department Head / Jawatankuasa
- ≥ RM 20,001: Mesyuarat MAIWP

```

## Future Enhancements (Not in Mockup)

- Authentication & Authorization (NextAuth.js)
- Database integration (Prisma + PostgreSQL)
- API routes for CRUD operations
- Real-time updates (WebSocket/SSE)
- File upload for documents
- Report generation (PDF export)
- SMS notifications
- Multi-language support
- Mobile responsive optimization
- Advanced analytics dashboards

## Notes

This is a **UI mockup prototype** demonstrating the user interface and workflows. It does not include:

- Backend API
- Database
- Authentication system
- Payment gateway integration
- Real IAS connectivity
- WhatsApp/Email sending

For production deployment, these components need to be implemented with proper security, testing, and integration with MAIWP's existing systems.
